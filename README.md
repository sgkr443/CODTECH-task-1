Name : S.Guru Kiran Reddy
Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
ID: CT6VLSI590
Domain: VLSI
Duration:June to August 5th
Mentor:N.Santosh Kumar

Overview of the project:

Project : Design basic digital logic circuits like logic gates, adders, and multiplexers using
Verilog within the VLSI software. Simulate the Verilog designs to ensure correct
functionality. Use the waveform viewer in the VLSI software to analyze the
simulation results.

Objective:
  The objective of this project is to design adders, multiplexers,logic gates using verilog with VLSI software so i designed some circuits using them.

  Key Activities:
  -> Writing Code
  -> Synthesising circuit
  -> Timing Diagrams
Technologies Used:
->Xilinx Vivado
